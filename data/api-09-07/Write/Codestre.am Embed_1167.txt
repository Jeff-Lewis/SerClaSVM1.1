Embedding service for computer terminal recordings
Codestre.am Embed
Codestre.am allows people to stream or record actions taken on their terminals. This allows them to create and share tutorials, collaborate on coding, or show errors that they&#039;re running into. Such recordings are also known as &quot;codestreams&quot;. The Codestre.am Embed JavaScript API allows users to embed codestreams on their webpage or blog.
