API aggregation service
Zypr
Zypr is an application with an API that is designed to work across a variety of platforms, including mobiles, web applications, and other electronic devices. Zypr&#039;s API collects numerous APIs, like Facebook, Twitter, weather APIs, and Amazon, categorizes them based on function, and turns those APIs into one API.

Zypr&#039;s API, like Apple&#039;s Siri, allows developers to write voice activated commands for integration into other applications. Some example API methods include adding appointments to calendars, posting on Facebook or Twitter, and checking weather.
