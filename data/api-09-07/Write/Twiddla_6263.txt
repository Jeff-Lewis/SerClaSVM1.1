Real-time online meeting and collaboration tool
Twiddla
Twiddla is a real-time online collaboration tool. Twiddla&#039;s API lets users host Twiddla meetings on their own website. Users can create new meetings on the fly and embed them into any page they like. Users can disable the bits they don&#039;t want to see, and can show their own logo instead of ours. This RESTful API returns results in XML or CSV.
