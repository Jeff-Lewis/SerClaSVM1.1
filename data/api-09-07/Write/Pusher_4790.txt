Real-time push service
Pusher
Pusher is a simple hosted API for quickly, easily and securely adding realtime bi-directional functionality via WebSockets to web and mobile apps, or any other Internet connected device.

We offer a rich suite of libraries that you can use within your applications, including a JavaScript client library for web and HTML5 apps.

Our event based abstraction makes it simple to bind UI interactions to events that are triggered from any client or server.

We use WebSockets (with &#039;fallback to Flash&#039; in the JavaScript client library) to future proof your applications and make it easy for you to add bi-directional communication to your apps whilst keeping data usage to a minimum.

As well as a WebSockets API, we have a REST API for publishing your messages. This is ideally suited to web server technologies and we have a set of REST API libraries in many common languages to help you to do this.

We have a simple Publish/Subscribe model based on channels that allows you to filter and control how people receive your messages.

We supply functionality such as authentication mechanisms for private channels, and presence functionality for keeping track of who&#039;s online.
