Utah geocoding service
OremGeocoder
The OremGeocoder API allows GIS applications to plot Orem, UT addresses even when street names are placed before house numbers, streets have more than one name, or address coordinates don&#039;t match any streets at all. A closely related API that consumes this one informs the user which polygon on the map contains a given address.
