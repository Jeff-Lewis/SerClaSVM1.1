Art Project that Collects Data from an Emotional State Survey
Emotional Cities
Emotional Cities is an art project that studies and visualizes the emotions of individuals and groups. It uses data gathered from it&#039;s website, where users can log on and answer the question &quot;How are you today?&quot;

Emotional Cities also provides a REST API allowing developers to query the Emotional Cities data and create their own applications around it. The API methods mostly relate to &#039;mood&#039; but there are a few other bits of data the API can provide, such as a city&#039;s weather report.
