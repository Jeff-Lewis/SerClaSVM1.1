Local user reviews and city guides
Yelp
The Yelp APIs are RESTful APIs and users can retrieve business review and rating, information for a particular geographic region or location.display review information for a particular business, determine accurate neighborhood name information for a particular location, track recent reviews for a particular business, display pictures of highly rated local businesses and of the top reviewers for that business, determine a particular business&#039; review and rating information based on the phone number for that business. The default output is JSON. This output format was chosen due to the availability of JSON parsers in many languages. The Yelp v2.0 API enables access to more relevant search results that more closely match the results on Yelp. It uses a standard and secure authorization protocol (OAuth 1.0a, xAuth).
