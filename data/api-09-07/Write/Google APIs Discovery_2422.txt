Google API directory service
Google APIs Discovery
This lightweight API is used within Google and made available to other developers. It makes all of Google&#039;s APIs listable and provides additional information about each API, including a full list of resources or methods.

Google uses the API Discovery API internally to maintain client libraries for all of its APIs, as well as to fill a sandbox with potential API calls.
