Phylogenetic tree creation service
EBI ClustalW2 Phylogeny
ClustalW2 Phylogeny generates phylogenetic trees from multiple sequence alignment data. Users can choose between two methods of calculating phylogeny; neighbor joining or UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean). The ClustalW2 Phylogeny API, provided by the European Bioinformatics Institute, makes these functions available over SOAP and REST protocols.
