Academic publication information service
NCSU Scholarly Publications Repository
The service provides access to source citations and other metadata about publications logged in the repository. The library provides this machine-readable access to extend and connect the repository&#039;s information to formats other than those currently provided.

The API supports submission of search queries as HTTP requests that specify CGI variables. Methods return a response in XML that other applications may transform or format as needed.
