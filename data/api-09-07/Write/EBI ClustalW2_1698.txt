Global multiple sequence alignment service
EBI ClustalW2
ClustalW2 is a program for the global multiple alignment of biological sequences. It can align anywhere from 3 to 500 DNA or protein sequences. One notable feature of this alignment program is that it considers sequence redundancy. The European Bioinformatics Institute makes this service available as an API via SOAP or REST protocols.
