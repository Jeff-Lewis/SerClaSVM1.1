text-based task management platform
Cheddar
Cheddar allows for task management with an emphasis on event syncing between multiple devices. Functions include: creating tasks, adding tags, setting due dates and assigning tasks to people.

Cheddar simplifies the process through a simple usage of text. You type your task in the field, then press return and that&#039;s it. The task is created and shared between the user&#039;s devices. Users can also tag a task, using a hashtag like Twitter.

The API utilizes a REST protocol with responses in JSON. Authentication is provided through OAuth2.
