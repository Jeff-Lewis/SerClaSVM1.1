IST Bioinformatics Web Services
IST Bioinformatics Web Services (IBWS) is a suite of APIs provided by the Bioinformatics Unit of the National Cancer Research Institute (IST) of Genoa. These APIs allow users to access all databases available in public SRS sites, Common Access to Biological Resources and Information (CABRI) catalogs, and an SRS implementation of the IARC TP53 Mutation Database. All of the IBWS APIs are accessible via the SOAP protocol.
