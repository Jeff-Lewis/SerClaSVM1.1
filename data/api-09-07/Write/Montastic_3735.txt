Website and server monitoring service
Montastic
Montastic is an online site and server monitoring service. When your services go down or become unreachable for some reason, Montastic will alert you through an email when the services are down and again when they are restored. Monitoring frequency is up to every 5 minutes (paid). Montastic will check URLs through a mixture of HTTP HEAD and GET requests, depending on what&#039;s most appropriate.

The RESTful Montastic API allows 3rd party developers the opportunity to integrate Montastic services directly into their own applications. Checkpoint info, creation, deletion, listing and editing methods are all included in the API.
