Non-profit Internet library and historical archive
Internet Archive
From their site: The Internet Archive is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that was founded to build an Internet library, with the purpose of offering permanent access for researchers, historians, and scholars to historical collections that exist in digital format. Founded in 1996. The Internet Archive Contribution Engine supports some advanced functionality to enable high volume contributors to more easily (and less interactively) upload and import content into the Archive.
