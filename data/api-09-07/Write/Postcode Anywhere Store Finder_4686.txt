The Store Finder API can be used to let developers provide customers with the location of the nearest store. The API geocodes the postcodes of all of a site owner&#039;s stores, geocodes a site visitor&#039;s location and presents a list of the nearest stores.

The API uses a number of protocols including REST, SOAP and XML-RPC. Responses can be formatted in XML, JSON, CSV, HTML and PDF.
