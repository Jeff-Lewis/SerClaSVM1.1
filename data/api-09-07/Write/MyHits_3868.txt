Protein domain database
MyHits
MyHits is a free database devoted to protein domains. It is also a collection of tools for investigating the relationships between protein sequences and the motifs described on them. Motifs are defined by a heterogeneous collection of predictors, including regular expressions, generalized profiles, and hidden Markov models. Much of MyHits&#039; data and functions are available via SOAP API.
