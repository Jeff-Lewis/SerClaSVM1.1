XML repository content management service
NSDL Repository Update Service
The National Science Digital Library (NSDL) is the national online portal for education and research on learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in the United States. The NSDL provides a XML repository search server tool called the Digital Discovery System (DDS), complete with an API built on top of Apache Lucene.

When a user uses the DDS tool in conjunction with a XML repository, they can use RESTful calls to remotely create, update, and delete collections and items in their repository using the DDS&#039;s  Repository Update Service web service. Client access to a DDS repository system and, likewise, the API is governed by a list of valid IP&#039;s that can be specified in the DDS&#039;s Collection Manager interface.
