Find Wikipedia articles based on location
WikiLocation
The WikiLocation API is for developers wishing to search for Wikipedia articles by location. The data is gathered by downloading the Wikipedia database on a weekly basis and then parsing all of the geocoded entries. This data is stored in a database where it is able to be accessed via the API. 

WikiLocation supports 36 languages, totaling over 3.8 million articles. At present, there are over 1 million entries from en.wikipedia.org alone.

In addition to searching via location, users can also search via the venue and spot IDs of the two most popular geo-location networks; Foursquare and Gowalla as well as by Yahoo! WOEID. The API uses RESTful protocol and responses are formatted in XML, JSON, or JSONP.
