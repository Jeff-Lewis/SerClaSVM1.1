Website location service
Loki
Loki is a service that adds locations to websites. When a website visitor visits a site with Loki, the visitor&#039;s exact location can be identified, enabling location-based advertisements, local businesses, and local social media. 

The Loki API allows developers to integrate Loki&#039;s functionality into websites. The API calls for locations of visitors and IP addresses to accurately access Loki&#039;s location functions.
