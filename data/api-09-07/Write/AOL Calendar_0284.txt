Online calendar service
AOL Calendar
The AOL Calendar API provides access, with authorization, to a user&#039;s AOL Calendar. Using standard protocols and data formats, the API can access events within a calendar. In addition to a user&#039;s own calendar, developers can also access public calendars and also add or remove a user&#039;s subscription to specific calendars.
