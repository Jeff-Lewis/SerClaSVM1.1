Live flight aircraft and delays tracking
FlightView
Use FlightView data feeds to obtain flight status, flight schedule data, and airport delay information in XML. Use the feed data to help your customers adjust plans because of flight changes, delays, and cancellations; you might feed your Flight Information Display Systems (FIDS), Limousine Scheduling and Dispatch systems, and so on with live FlightView data.
