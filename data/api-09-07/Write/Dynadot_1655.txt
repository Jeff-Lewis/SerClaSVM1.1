Internet domain name lookup and registration services
Dynadot
The Dynadot API allows you to search for and register domain names programmatically. The API is only available to accounts that qualify for bulk pricing. For the Search feature, submit a URL and get a response of Yes or No about whether the domain is available. For the Register command, submit the domain name to register plus a duration, and then get a result of success or failure and an expiration date in unix time. You can also delete a domain that is still in the grace period.
