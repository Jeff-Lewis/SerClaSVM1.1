Music concert and event community
Songkick
From their site: At Songkick we&#039;ve spent a lot of time collecting data about live music, and now we want to see what you can do with it. We&#039;re currently putting together an API to allow access to much of the data available on the website. This is very much a work in progress, but we&#039;re making what we have available as a preview to participants in the Music Hack Day taking place over the weekend of July 11th and 12th 2009.
