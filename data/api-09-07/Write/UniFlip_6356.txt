Online flipbook creation and management service
UniFlip
Uniflip is a self service publishing system providing epublishing and file conversion services for clients wishing to create and publish a PDF flipbook. Uniflip can convert your personal or company&#039;s print resources into an interactive media package that is flippable and can be hosted through UniFlip or the client&#039;s own, personal server.

The API allows developers to upload files, utilize publication lists, and gather publication information through a few, simple GET and POST HTTP-based API calls. The user can also create and post and edit publications to UniFlip, activate licenses, and more.
