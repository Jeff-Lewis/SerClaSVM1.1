Application development tools
Temboo
Temboo helps developers by providing tools that simplify app development. These tools include code shortcuts that can be dragged and dropped into a developers own code via a visual interface. The code shortcuts, called Choreos allow for API integration by handling authentication, credential management, updates, and more. Currently Temboo has a library of Choreos for over 70 APIs.

The Temboo REST API lets users perform CRUD operations with methods that allow users to:

* Retrieve a list of Choreos that can be run
* Retrieve detailed information, such as inputs, status, and description data for a specific Choreo
* Run a Choreo, optionally providing input values to use in that execution
* Retrieve the list of currently running Choreo executions
* Retrieve the status of a Choreo that has been executed via the API
* Terminate a currently running Choreo execution

The API uses RESTful calls and responses are formatted in XML.
