Recommendations and semantic search service
Evri
Use the Evri API to get access to Evri&#039;s mapping of the entity web, or the web of people, places and things connected to one another via language. Portions of Evri&#039;s NLP-based (natural language processing) technology are exposed in the API as well as Evri&#039;s knowledgebase of information. 

With this API you can:

* tag, or identify entities in text or HTML documents
* get recommended articles, images or videos
* find how people, places and things are related to one another
* find facts from a large database of people, places, and things
