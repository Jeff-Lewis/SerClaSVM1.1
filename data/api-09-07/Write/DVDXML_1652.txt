DVD collection management service
DVDXML
The subscription service provides management tools for a DVD collection. It logs user submissions of new items and allows lookup access to the subscriber&#039;s own DVD records as well as those of other users. Records are managed as dvdid.xml files that trigger retrieval of descriptive information about a DVD in CRC64 format.

API methods accept requests for records about particular DVDs by title. Records with partial title matches are returned. Only subscribers to the service can access the API.
