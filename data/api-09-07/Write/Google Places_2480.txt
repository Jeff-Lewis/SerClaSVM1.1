Local business and point of interest service
Google Places
The Google Places Web Service is a service that returns information about a &quot;place&quot;: an establishment, a geographic location, or prominent point of interest using an HTTP request. Place requests specify locations as latitude/longitude coordinates.

Two basic Place requests are available: a Place Search request and a Place Details request. Generally, a Place Search request is used to return candidate matches, while a Place Details request returns more specific information about a Place.
