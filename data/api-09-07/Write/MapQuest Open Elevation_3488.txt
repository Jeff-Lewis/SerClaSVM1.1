Elevation data service
MapQuest Open Elevation
The Open Elevation API provides elevations and distances given coordinates in JSON or XML formats.  The two output options are a raw output of the data and an elevation chart.  Best used in conjunction with MapQuest&#039;s Open Directions Service to generate an elevation chart for your route.
