Security service to verify URLs
Google Safe Browsing
From their site: The Safe Browsing API is an experimental API that enables client applications to check URLs against Google&#039;s constantly updated blacklists of suspected phishing and malware pages. Your client application can use the API to download an encrypted table for local, client-side lookups of URLs that you would like to check.
