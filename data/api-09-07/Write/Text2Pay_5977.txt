Payment by text service
Text2Pay
Text2Pay is a mobile commerce service that allows users to pay for goods and services via text, rather than with a credit card. Merchants can integrate Text2Pay with their POS or other payment software to allow their customers to pay with Text2Pay.

The Text2Pay API allows developers to access and integrate the functionality of Text2Pay with other applications and POS systems. Public documentation is not available; interested developers should sign up here: http://text2pay.com/merchants/register. API access comes with a merchant account.
