Illinois public school grade reporting service
Illinois 2010 School Report Cards
The Illinois 2010 school report cards API allows users receive detailed data about public schools and school districts by appending the string &quot;.json&quot; to any Chicago Tribune school webpage. 

The response of this call will be a dictionary of data for that school, gathered from the Illinois State Board of Education&#039;s yearly reports. The API will also return lists of schools for a given district, city, or county. Additionally, the API provides limited support for searching by school name or latitude/longitude pair.

Note: The API has been updated for the 2011 scores.
