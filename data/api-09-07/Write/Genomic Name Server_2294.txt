Bioinformatics database
Genomic Name Server
Genomic Name Server (GeNS) provides unified access to data residing at different sources, under different schemas, and in different formats. Currently, GeNS is importing data from four major databases: UniProt (SwissProt and TrEMBL), KEGG, EMBL???EBI, and Entrez. Since these databases already incorporate data from third-party resources, GeNS can offer over 460,000 unique genes, more than 100,000 biological relations, and 140 distinct data types.
