Twitter spam prevention service
TWASE 
TWASE is an anti-spam engine that given a Twitter username can determine whether the thing behind it is a spammer, marketeer, bot or just disruptive member of the Twitterverse. TWASE will also enable developers to set customized filtering preferences such as follower-following ratios, tweet content regular expressions, and other things.
