Video Streaming Platform
Warp
Warp is a video streaming platform that provides video transcoding, management, streaming and analytics. The Warp API provides access to an authenticated account&#039;s data via a SOAP API (SDKs provided for PHP and C#). The API allows developers to read and write metadata about uploaded videos in their accounts. Developers can add, edit and remove categories from videos, search videos and delete videos.

A free demo account gives you two videos and paid accounts start at $49 for 250 videos.
