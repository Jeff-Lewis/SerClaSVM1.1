UN Data
The UN Data API project is an unofficial API version of the great data made available by the United Nations on the UNDATA site. The aim is to make this data accessible and reusable in a variety or ways so it can be easily mashed up and recombined into new applications or analysis. The service uses a straightforward REST API hosted on Google&#039;s Java AppEngine and makes UNDATA sets easily queryable from any application. Currently we have 62 datasets from the World Health organization on line and we will add more over time.
The service is free to use and publicly accessible ? you just need to sign up for an account to generate access keys. Standard accounts have some limits on usage but if you need more just contact us and we will arrange a higher limit.
