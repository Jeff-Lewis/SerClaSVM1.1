The global platform for human memory
Evernote
Evernote makes it easy to remember things big and small from your notable life using your computer, phone, and the web. 

Evernote&#039;s web service API provides secure access for your applications using the same network communications that are used by Evernote&#039;s own client software, including the ability to create, read, update and delete notes, notebooks and tags. 

Third party integrations are a critical part of the Evernote ecosystem and are heavily promoted via the [[http://www.evernote.com/about/trunk Evernote Trunk]] and [[http://blog.evernote.com/category/friends_partners/ company blog]].
