Spam, bot, and CAPTCHA sweatshop blocker
Xortify
Xortify was developed in response to attack on the XOOPS platform by rogue malicious bots, as well as CAPTCHA and spam sweat shops where individuals are paid less than 1 USD per day to set up accounts for bots to spam websites by typing past CAPTCHA puzzles. The Xortify client stops close to 99% of spam and CAPTCHA attacks. It does so by maintaining a local ban list of bad IP addresses. Users must sign up for Xortify to access this service, but they don&#039;t need to use Xortify&#039;s software to maintain or add bans to the framework. Xortify&#039;s functions are accessible programmatically via RESTful and SOAP-based APIs.
