Natural intelligence database
Saffron Sierra
Saffron Sierra is a developer site for using SaffronMemoryBase(SMB). The SMB stores &quot;associations&quot; or &quot;links&quot; between things so while it is organized like a relational database it acts as an information or knowledge store.

The RESTful API allows developers to interface with the SMB during application development. All calls are authenticated with an API key and responses are formatted in JSON.
