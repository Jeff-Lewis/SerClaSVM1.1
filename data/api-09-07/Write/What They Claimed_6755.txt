Expenses records for UK members of parliament
What They Claimed
The What They Claimed API allows access to the information database of expenses made by the UK members of parliament, published by Parliament in June 2009. The original data is being transcribed starting with high profile members of Parliament, but new members and expenses will continue to be added. Claims can be read by category of claim, person, date, and more.
