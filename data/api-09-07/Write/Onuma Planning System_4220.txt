Architectural planning and modeling service
Onuma Planning System
The Onuma Planning System (OPS) is web-based Building Information Modeling (BIM) tool. It can be used by architects, planners, engineers, builders, interior designers, and owners to design and model 3d structures. OPS provides a REST-based API to access data from their online studios, which can subsequently be used to create reports in an online or offline application. The API can also be used to link to and manipulate the data in 3rd party applications.
