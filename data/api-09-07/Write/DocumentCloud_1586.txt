Upload and Share Documents
DocumentCloud
DocumentCloud helps journalists track documents. It is a repository, as well as a tool for document-based investigative reporting. The company compares its repository to a card catalog. DocumentCloud was built to &quot;accelerate the work of reporters who need to make sense of large sets of documents.&quot;

The DocumentCloud API allows developers to create applications around DocumentCloud services. Authentication (HTTP Basic Auth) is not required for searching documents, but is required for everything else.
