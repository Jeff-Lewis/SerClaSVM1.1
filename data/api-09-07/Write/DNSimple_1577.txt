Domain management service
DNSimple
Register and update domains via the DNSimple API. Other commands allow you to transfer a domain from another registrar to DNSimple, create records for a domain, and create and apply templates to group common records together and apply them all at once to a domain. Plans start at $3 per month to manage 10 domains. Domains themselves cost $16 each.
