Zip code look-up service
Codebump Zip Codes
Zip Codes provides an API for searching zip code, city, and area code databases for Canada and the U.S. Possible uses include locating offices, demographic research, and address validation. The &quot;User-Defined Places&quot; feature allows the storage of custom locations in the Zip Codes database so that they can be queried just like a regular zip code or city.
