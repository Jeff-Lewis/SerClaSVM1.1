Bioinformatics data reformatting service
EBI MView
MView is a tool for re-formatting the results of a sequence database search or a multiple sequence alignment. It can also be used to add HTML markup to control results&#039; coloring and layout on a webpage. MView is not a multiple sequence alignment program, nor is it a general purpose alignment editor. The EBI MView API provides access to MView&#039;s functions via SOAP and REST protocols.
