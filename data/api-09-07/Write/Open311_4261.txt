Note: This is an API standard used by many API providers. For all compatible APIs listed on ProgrammableWeb, use the [[http://www.programmableweb.com/apitag/open311 open311 tag]].

Open311 allows developers to create third-party apps for citizens to report neighborhood issues from, potholes to graffiti and more, to a city&#039;s 311 system.

Open311 provides an Inquiry API to retrieve information such as services, facilities, and a 311 event update. The GeoReport API is the reporting API used to submit issues to the 311 service. These APIs are RESTful.
