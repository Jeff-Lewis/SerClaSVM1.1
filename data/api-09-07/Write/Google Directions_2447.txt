Driving directions web service
Google Directions
The Google Directions Web Service web service calculates directions between locations using an REST request. Directions may specify origins, destinations and waypoints either as text strings (e.g. &quot;Chicago, IL&quot;) or as latitude/longitude coordinates. The Directions web service can return multi-part directions using a series of waypoints.

This service is designed for giving directions for static addresses for placement of application content on a map and this service is not designed to respond in real time to user input, for example. 

The Directions Web Service is a companion to the existing Geocoding and Elevation Web Services, and allows applications to obtain Driving, Bicycling, and Walking directions through an XML/JSON REST interface. All of the features of the Map API v3 Directions service are supported, including ???avoid highways???, ???avoid tolls???, and waypoint optimization (travelling salesman solver).
