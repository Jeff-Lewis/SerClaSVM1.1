Data Integration Service
uberblic Doppelganger 
Uberblic is a web serice with the goal of making 3rd-party APIs and data sources interoperable, both with one another and with existing databases. The uberblic Doppelganger service connects data in many different third-party APIs by mapping an entity&#039;s &#039;doppelgangers&#039;, the IDs of that same entity in other APIs. Uberblic can be thought of as a dictionary for entity IDs across the web, storing a rich set of contextual data available to developers, with Uberblic?s APIs serving as a switchboard and broker between data sources.
