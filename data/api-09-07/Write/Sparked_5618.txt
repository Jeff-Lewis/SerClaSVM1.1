Microvolunteering platform
Sparked
Sparked is a microvolunteering platform that allows people to volunteer for small amounts of time or money online. Non-profits offer up &quot;challenges&quot; on Sparked that volunteers can sign up for and complete online. 

The Sparked API allows developers to access the data from Sparked through an XML feed of open challenges. This data can be integrated into other applications and sites.
