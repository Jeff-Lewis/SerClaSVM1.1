Genealogy search service
Family Tree Maker
The service, associated with Ancestry.com, provides search results against the provider&#039;s database of genealogy and family history information. Functionality supports synchronizing a desktop Family Tree Maker database with online member family trees. Documentation comes from a third-party source.

API methods support submitting a search for genealogical information about an individual specifying related family roles and profile data. Methods also allow listing of providers with information potentially related to that search.
